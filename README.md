# AccidentsData
A Data Analytics project with efforts to draw conclusions from US accidents data from June 2016 - June 2020.

### Exploratory Data Analysis 
For a Simple EDA process, I started by eliminating the unnecessary features first. This is still a WIP. My main goals for the next few weeks towards this project are: 
  * Setup an Airflow-Spark data scheduler 
  * Completely understand the ETL processes required for the data.
  * Look at how the severity of accidents is affected by location.


### Conclusions
* The USA accidents dataset, taken from Kaggle, was analyzed, and results were discussed above.
* The dataset used in this project can be found at : https://www.kaggle.com/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents
* I have discovered a lot of exciting things like cities or states witnessed the most number of accidents in the US by visualizing the results on a map and even categorizing the severity level of an accident.
